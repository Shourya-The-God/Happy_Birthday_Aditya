          From our countless calls to our little but sweet adventures, every moment
          we've shared has been unforgettable. Remember all the good times we had in the ATL Lab or the times when you missed your bus just to wait for me ? Moments like those remind me how
          lucky I am to have you as my best friend.And I hope that like me you will never forget those invaluable memories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your kindness, intelligence, and unwavering support mean the world to
          me. As you step into this new year of your life, I hope it's filled with all the
          joy and success you deserve. Here's to many more memories and
          adventures together!
        </p>
